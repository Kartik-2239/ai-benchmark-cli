This is a clear One Piece lore question. \n\nHmm, I remember this iconic scene from chapter 1/episode 1 - it happened in a bar owned by Shanks. The fruit was never officially named during that scene, but through later canon revelations we know it's the Gomu Gomu no Mi. \n\nWait, actually recent manga chapters revealed it's actually the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika. But since the question specifically asks about what it was called at the time of eating, \"Gomu Gomu no Mi\" is the correct answer because that's all anyone knew then. \n\nThe user wants just one sentence, so I'll keep it concise. They probably want immediate trivia confirmation rather than deep lore discussion. No need to complicate it with post-reveal information unless asked. \n\n*checks memory* Yes, definitely Gomu Gomu no Mi. The rubber properties matched that name perfectly until the big twist. Bar location confirms it's the same fruit. Simple answer for a straightforward question.\n</think>\nLuffy ate the **Gomu Gomu no Mi (Rubber-Rubber Fruit)** at Party's Bar.",

I recall this is from the \"Romance Dawn\" arc - Luffy's origin story where he meets Shanks and his crew. The key moment involves young Luffy wanting to join Shanks' pirates but being told he's too weak. To prove his courage, Luffy did something drastic.\n\nThe dramatic act was scarring himself. He took Shanks' knife and stabbed himself fiercely below the left eye. That's why adult Luffy has that distinctive facial scar. The bar fight aftermath led to the \"patched up\" reference - Shanks' crew bandaged him while scolding his recklessness.\n\nThe user might be either rewatching early episodes or settling a debate. Since they need just one sentence, I'll make it comprehensive by including 1) the action, 2) the tool used, and 3) the consequence implied by being patched up. I should avoid naming Shanks directly since the question doesn't ask about his crew's reaction, just Luffy's act and its result.\n</think>\nTo prove his toughness and worthiness to Shanks' crew, Luffy stabbed himself in the face with a knife below his left eye, requiring them to patch up his serious wound at the bar.",
